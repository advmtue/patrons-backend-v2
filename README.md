Rewrite of Patrons Hospitality Management backend.

**This software is now obsolete**

## What is this?
Patron's Hospitality Management was a venue managemenet software predominately focused on guest management and table check-in.

On the 27th of March 2021, the Victorian government mandated that all QR check-in facilities liaise with their Visitation API, else businesses would face limiting consequences.

Under government discretion PHS was not granted access to the Vic Gov Visitation API, and subsequently was no longer viable in businesses.
